## About

Crafting the Star Wars Planets Directory has been an exhilarating journey, where I seamlessly blended my expertise in ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and Lottie animation to push the boundaries of frontend development. Leveraging the SWAPI, I meticulously designed and developed a dynamic application that not only presents essential planetary information but also brings to life the iconic Star Wars universe through interactive features and engaging animations. Every decision, from framework selection to UI/UX enhancements, was made with the sole purpose of delivering a polished, user-friendly experience across all devices. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to showcase my skills and eagerly anticipate discussing my approach and contributions further.
